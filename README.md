# odin-landing-page
The Odin Project's Landing Page design. Woowee.

Completed over the course of two 45 minute coding sessions. Did section A in one block (fumbled a bit) and then did the remainder of the task in the second session. Got through it much quicker than I thought, which is why there's so few commits.
